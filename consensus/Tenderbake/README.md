# Tenderbake specification

For more information about Tenderbake, see [Tenderbake](./Tenderbake.md)

## Spec design

TODO

### Simplifications/assumptions

- dynamic level comittees
  - committes depend only on the level
  - proposer depends on the round within the level
- `n >= 3f + 1` where `n` is the number of bakers and `f` is the number of faulty bakers
- all committee members have the ability to communicate with one another
- no mempool
- TODO

## Run the code = verify the specification's properties
